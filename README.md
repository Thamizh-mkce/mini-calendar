# Mini Calendar

This project is a simple mini calendar that displays the current date, including the month, day of the week, day number, and year. The calendar is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the calendar.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the calendar elements.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the logic for updating the calendar with the current date.

## Files

### `index.html`

This is the main HTML file that contains the structure of the mini calendar. It includes:

- A `div` container with the class `calendar-container`, which houses the calendar elements.
- Four `p` elements with IDs `month-name`, `day-name`, `day-number`, and `year` to display the month, day of the week, day number, and year, respectively.
- A link to the `style.css` file for styling.
- A script tag that links to the `index.js` file for functionality.

### `style.css`

This file contains the styling rules for the mini calendar, such as layout, fonts, colors, and spacing.

### `index.js`

This file contains the JavaScript logic to dynamically update the calendar with the current date when the page loads.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the mini calendar.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the calendar by editing the `style.css` file. If you want to change the logic or add more functionality, you can modify the `index.js` file.
